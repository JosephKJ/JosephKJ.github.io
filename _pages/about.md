I am a PhD student at IIT Hyderabad. I am fortunate to have <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Vineeth Balasubramanian</a>, as my advisor. I work on generative modelling using Deep Learning. I am also interested in detection algotithms.

Before joining IIT Hyderabad, I was working at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, as a Senior Software Engineer for 3.5 years. I used to develop softwares for PeopleSoft PeopleTools Platforms team.
